# icirr-app

## Overview
This is a cross-platform [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) application running assets built via webpack.

#### Getting started quickly
We use [github issues](https://github.com/chi-immigration-task-force/icirr-app/issues) to track the tasks we need to do for this project. Right now this hasn't been filled in but I'm hoping to get to it this week...

If you're interested in getting involved technically, all you need to do is clone the repository and [install yarn](https://github.com/chi-immigration-task-force/icirr-app#install-yarn). Then check out the section on [developing](https://github.com/chi-immigration-task-force/icirr-app#developing).

If you don't know React yet, Facebook's [React tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html) is a good place to start.

If you don't know Javascript yet, this may not be the best project to jump into, but I'm happy to help you learn it in whatever way I can! I have a lot of faith in [Khan Academy's introduction](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming). I think that [Code Academy's](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-javascript) is a bit faster if you already feel comfortable programming, but in a different language. I also generally recommend [Javascript the Good Parts](http://bdcampbell.net/javascript/book/javascript_the_good_parts.pdf) even to experienced developers.

## Installation
First, clone the repository by running `git clone https://github.com/chi-immigration-task-force/icirr-app.git` (or `git clone git@github.com:chi-immigration-task-force/icirr-app.git` if you prefer ssh).

### Install yarn
Follow the instructions [here](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-tab).
Using whatever approach you prefer. Ping @yjkogan if you need help.

### Install Cordova
Instructions directly from cordova are [here](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/cli/index.html)

1. Globally install cordova with `npm install -g cordova`. Depending on your npm setup, you may need to add sudo but don't do it blindly!
2. To use Cordova for iOS developement, you'll need [Cocoapods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html). To install this, add the following to your `~/.profile` or `~/.bash_profile` (or anything else)

  ```bash
  export GEM_HOME=$HOME/.gem
  export PATH=$GEM_HOME/bin:$PATH
  ```

  `source` that file or open a new shell, and then run `gem install cocoapods`.
  To make sure it's installed, check with `gem which cocoapods`.

3. Run `pod setup` to sync the cocoapods repo. This takes forever and cordova actually warns you of this. Cocoapods is mostly great, but this part of it fucking sucks.

### Install Android Studio
1. [Download Android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
2. Follow the installation instructions listed there (aka drag the app into the Applications folder and open it)
3. Open the SDK Manager from Android studio. The button is towards the right and is a downward arrow
4. From there, open the standalone SDK manager (maybe not needed?) and install "Android SDK Build-tools" Rev 24.0.3. You'll need to accept the licenses.

And you're done! You may need to install more than just that one build tool. If that's the case, please update the docs.

### Install Xcode
1. Download it from the app store? I think you can also download it directly from the apple developer site, which I usually try to do because then updates don't act as stupidly...
2. Open Xcode at least once to accept the license agreement and
  install the command line tools

## Running the app
### Initializing the platforms and plugins
Run `./project.sh -i` to initialize and install all the plugins and platforms. **Untested on a new machine. Please let Yonatan know if you hit any issues.**

Once the platforms are installed, you can run `cordova emulate ios --target="iPad-Air-2, 10.1"` to open the iPad Simulator. If you hit **xcode-select: error: tool 'xcodebuild' requires Xcode, but active developer directory '/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools' is a command line tools instance**, try running `sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`. If that doesn't work or you want more info, check out [this issue](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/issues/569#issuecomment-255589932).

## Developing
We're doing development like it's a website and then copying the results of a
production build of the web assets into cordova to generate the native apps.
To get started, from inside `icirr-app/web/`, run `yarn && yarn start`. You should then be able to see the existing site at `http://localhost:3000/`.

All the website files live in `/web/src`. Feel free to poke around! The
primary technologies we use are:

1. [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
2. [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)


## Debugging
### iOS
#### Debugging the native <-> webview interface
Using Xcode, open `platforms/ios/IcirrApp.xcworkspace`. From here, you can run the app normally, set breakpoints, see console logs, etc. Here's Cordova's [iOS debugging page](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/ios/index.html#debugging)

#### Debugging the webview itself
With the app running, open Safari, select `Develop -> Simulator -> localhost`. You then have the standard Safari debugger. Change `Simulator` to the relevant device name and `localhost` to the relevant title as needed.

### Android
TODO...
